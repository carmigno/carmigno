**Hello, I am Carmine (he/him/his)!**

I am a Senior data engineer from Naples, in southern Italy. I am currently based in Amsterdam.

I work for Ahold Delhaize. Previously I have worked for RTL and Leaseplan as a consultant under the Devoteam flag.

Before that, I used to analyze hospitals' data to evaluate the quality of the care they offer. The languages I used every day for those tasks were t-SQL, Python, and VBA/Excel. I studied Biomedical Engineering, with a focus on biomedical imaging and image processing (with and without AI). I worked in research, going from nanotechnologies to the cognitive neuroscience of face processing.

I am very passionate about arts, game design, music, politics, and humanities in general. 
I would love to put my skills at the service of those fields, so if you have something I could help you with, reach out to me!
