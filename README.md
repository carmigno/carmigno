**Hello, I am Carmine (he/him/his)!**

I am a Data Engineering Consultant from Naples, in southern Italy. I am currently based in Amsterdam.

I am a consultant at Devoteam, and my customer is currently RTL Nederland. I lead the Data Platform Team, in charge of developing, deploying and maintaining all the data-related applications and the data-related cloud infrastructure in use by the data science, analytics engineering and data analytics teams.

Before I used to analyze hospitals' data to evaluate the quality of the care they offer. The languages I used everyday for those tasks were t-SQL, Python and VBA/Excel. I studied Biomedical Engineering, with a focus in biomedical imaging and image processing (with and without AI). I worked in research, going from nanotechnologies to the cognitive neuroscience of face processing.

I am very passionate about art, music, politics and humanities, and I would love to put my skills at the service of those fields. 
If you have something I could help you with, reach out to me!
